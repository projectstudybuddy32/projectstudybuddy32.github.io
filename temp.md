## Development Guide
<br> 
The development workflow that was used for this project revolved around the Issue Driven Project Management process. The major goals of the project were divided down into Milestones. Each milestone was further split into multiple tasks that would take an average of 2-3 development days. Each of these tasks were converted to issues using GitHub's project management platform. To split up the work load, our team members individually strived to pick up tasks to work on for the moment as well as assign themselves tasks for after they completed their first task.

*Below is a timeline of our Milestones*
<br> 
### Milestone 1: Mockup development
<br> 
The development span for this milestone was about 2 weeks. Our main goal in this milestone was to create a basic mockup of pages with the barebone HTML and style formatting needed to show the future vision of our site. In order to speed up development, the app was developed using the Meteor platform. Using this platform allowed us to practice templating. Flowrouters were used to achieve our page routing.

### Milestone 2: Data Aggregation and Functionality
<br> 
This milestone took about 3 weeks to complete. The primary focus for this milestone was to instill basic functionality. This meant that we first needed to aggregate data and create meaninful user demos to test the functionality. The operations would revolve around a data model of Javascript classes that would hold collections of the data we intended to store. 
<br> <br>
First, a BaseCollection would create a skeleton of schema handling and get and set style functionality. This class would be the parent to our ProfileCollection and InterestCollection. The ProfileCollection would hold the data for each user while the Interest Collection would hold information regarding each major initially. In the future we plan to add more study habits to the interest collection but for basic functionality purposes, we wanted to have something uniform available for our test users.
