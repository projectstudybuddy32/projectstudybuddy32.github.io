# Overview

## The Problem:
Many students study alone, and thus, spend more time than necessary on school work because they don't take advantage of study groups. The wasted time decreases their stamina and potentially their grades. 

## The Solution:
Create an app that facilitates the communication and selective process needed for study groups to form, so that students can create networks faster and more effectively. 

## UHStudyNet Vision
 - Encourage collaborative learning and peer networking
 - Gain traffic for the campus study hubs 
 - ICS space, learning emporium, library, etc
 - Facilitate communication for all stages of study group interaction
 - Build more effective groups by connecting students based on learning styles and preferences

# Login Page
This is exactly like the standard CAS login pop up page seen on UH websites 

<br>
<br>


# User Home Page
Each user has their own home page that shows their connections, preferences and a quick summary of their school TODO tasks.

# Admin Page
Shows the full user database and eventually will allow admins to flag users under green, yellow, or red.
 - Green  = good standing
 - Yellow = under warning from complaints to admin
 - Red    = about to cross the line - could be deleted soon
Admins will have access to delete accounts once they pass the red flag.
