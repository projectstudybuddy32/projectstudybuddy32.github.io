# About UHStudyNet

## The Problem:
Many students study alone, and thus, spend more time than necessary on school work because they don't take advantage of study groups. The wasted time decreases their stamina and potentially their grades. 

## The Solution:
Create an app that facilitates the communication and selective process needed for study groups to form, so that students can create networks faster and more effectively. 

## UHStudyNet Vision
 - Encourage collaborative learning and peer networking
 - Gain traffic for the campus study hubs 
 - ICS space, learning emporium, library, etc
 - Facilitate communication for all stages of study group interaction
 - Build more effective groups by connecting students based on learning styles and preferences

 <br>

# Admin Page
Shows the full user database and eventually will allow admins to flag users under green, yellow, or red.
 - Green  = good standing
 - Yellow = under warning from complaints to admin
 - Red    = about to cross the line - could be deleted soon
Admins will have access to delete accounts once they pass the red flag.
